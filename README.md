This was an interesting and difficult assignment. i had the most truble with getting the response to display the answer instead i get undefined and i dont know what im not getting in the code.

I added the arrays for uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
I made the arrays into an if statement so the website asks you how letters there are, should it have capital and lowercase, should there be numbers, and should there be special characters.
I made the if statements displey that there should be a set ammount of characters to the password if you say wou want more than 128 or less than 8.
i made the if statements display to show that there should be at least one set of characters selected if you decline all of them.
